        Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926-September 28, 1991)<br>
        was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. 
        He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the 
        history of jazz and 20th-century music.<br>
        Davis adopted a variety of musical directions 
        in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront 
        of many major stylistic developments in jazz.
