        Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926-September 28, 1991)<br>
        was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. 
        He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the 
        history of jazz and 20th-century music.<br>
        Davis adopted a variety of musical directions 
        in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront 
        of many major stylistic developments in jazz.

        <em>“Do not fear mistakes - there are none. ”</em><br>
        <em>"For me, music and life are all about style.”</em><br>
        <em>"A legend is an old man with a cane known for what he used to do. I'm still doing it."</em>
